## Features

- **React Native** with Expo for seamless cross-platform development
- **NativeWind** for Tailwind CSS styling in React Native
- **Expo** for easy setup and fast development with managed workflows
- **TypeScript** support for type-safe code (if enabled)

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or newer)
- **npm** or **pnpm** package manager
- **Expo CLI**: Install via `npm install -g expo-cli`

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

Use `npm` to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
#### OR

Use `pnpm` to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Start the Development Server

Launch the Expo development server with:

```bash
npm start
```

#### OR

```bash
pnpm start
```

This will start the Expo development environment, where you can preview the app on an emulator or physical device.

```

## Configuration

### Tailwind CSS with NativeWind

1. Configure **Tailwind CSS** in `tailwind.config.js`:

    ```js
    // tailwind.config.js
    module.exports = {
      content: [
        "./App.js",
        "./screens/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
        "./components/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"
      ],
      theme: {
        extend: {},
      },
      plugins: [],
    }
    ```

2. **NativeWind** is already configured to support Tailwind classes in your React Native components. Use Tailwind classes as usual in your components.
3.  *Optional* you can install **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense** Extension in VSCode 


## Scripts

- **`pnpm start`** - Start the Expo development server
- **`pnpm build`** - Build the app for production
